## Raising Issues

When raising [Issues](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/issues), please follow the template and fill the correponding fields. Details matter.

If you are trying to report a vulnerability, please refer to our [Security Policy](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Contributing to the source code

### Backend

The backend is written in Go. To set up a full local development environment — including a local Kubernetes cluster, the Everest operator, and all dependent services — follow the [Backend Development Guide](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/blob/main/dev/README.md).

### Frontend

The frontend is a TypeScript/React monorepo managed with PNPM and Turborepo. For details on the UI stack, local development setup, and available scripts, see the [Frontend Development Guide](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/blob/main/ui/README.md).

### Signing Your Work (Developer Certificate of Origin)

Each commit must be signed off. By doing so, you confirm that you have the right to license your contribution under the project's license. See [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).

Use `-s` if you have `user.name` and `user.email` configured in Git:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

Or add it manually in the commit message:

```
your commit message

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.org>
```

To always sign off automatically, set a Git alias:

```bash
git config --global alias.ci "commit -s"
git ci -m "your commit message"
```

## Local quality checks

Before opening a PR, run local checks to keep CI green.

### Copyright headers

Every `*.go`, `*.ts`, and `*.tsx` source file must carry an Apache 2.0 copyright header.

To check files you changed in your branch run from the repository root:

```bash
make copyright-check
```

To automatically add missing headers to files you changed in your branch, run:

```bash
make copyright-headers
```

CI runs the check-only mode and reports files that are missing headers.

The command detects files that were added or modified relative to `main` (using `git merge-base`) plus any new untracked source files, and inserts the header where it is missing.

Files that contain `This file was auto-generated` are skipped automatically.
You can also exclude files or folders using `.copyrightignore` in the repository root.

You can also target specific files explicitly:

```bash
make copyright-check FILES="path/to/file.go path/to/file.ts"
make copyright-headers FILES="path/to/file.go path/to/file.ts"
```

For paths that contain spaces, pass a newline-delimited file list:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "path with spaces/file.ts" "another/path.go" > /tmp/changed_files.txt
make copyright-check FILES_FILE=/tmp/changed_files.txt
make copyright-headers FILES_FILE=/tmp/changed_files.txt
```

Or override the base branch:

```bash
make copyright-check BASE_BRANCH=develop
make copyright-headers BASE_BRANCH=develop
```

## Community Meetings
